For now, landing page is finished.

Second and more importantly, work on the app: we will need to create a database where all the bars say their city, and a calendar where they post the matches and the time
Once we gather a good amount of bars, we need to make an app that sends bars per city requested and matches. 

After that, the next action needs to be the "I am in" system, where bars can be notified by users that want to go. This way, they get on a "VIP" list of sorts, where bars
can give them special offers.
